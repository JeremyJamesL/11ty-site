<!-- Excerpt End -->

# Counting
 
Basic stuff, numbers:

| it      | eng   |
|---------|-------|
| uno     | one   |
| due     | two   |
| tre     | three |
| quattro | four  |
| cinque  | five  |
| sei     | six   |
| sett    | seven |
| otto    | eight |
| nove    | nine  |
| dieci   | ten   |

> Remember when you are walking around to count in Italian. See some text on a sign somewhere? Repeat in your head in Italian. 



## Family Members

| ENG      | IT   |Plural  |
|---------|-------|-------|
| brother     | fratello   |  fratelli  |
| sister     | sorella   |sorelle  |
| mother     | madre |madri  |
| father | padre  |padri  |
| son  | figlio  |figli  |
| daughter     | figlia   |figlie  |
| wife     | moglie   |mogli  |
| husband     | marito   |mariti  |

To combine numbers and family members, we can say something like:

## Introducing family members

To say something like "*This is my son*", we can do the following:

> Questo è mio figlio

**Questo**  = "This is" in the masculine. 

**è** is the present indicative of the verb **essere** ("to be"). 

To say "*This is my daughter*" we can say

> Questa è mia figlia

## Combining #s and family members

So we can count, we know family members names, how do we combine and say something like *"I have a brother"*?

> Ho una fratella

**ho** means **I have**, being the present tense conjugation of the irregular verb **avere** ("to have").

To pluralise:

> Ho due fratelli

*"I have two brothers"*

> Ho uno sorello e due fratelli

"*I have one sister and two brothers*"

## Exercise

Try writing out the members of your family:

> Mia madre si chiama Phillipa, e mia padre si chiama David. Ho uno fratello e uno sorella, Alex e Chloe. Mia moglie si chiama Lisa. 

Should hopefully translate to:

*"My mother is called Phillipa and my father is called David. I have one brother and one sister, Alex and Chloe. My wife is called Lisa"*
